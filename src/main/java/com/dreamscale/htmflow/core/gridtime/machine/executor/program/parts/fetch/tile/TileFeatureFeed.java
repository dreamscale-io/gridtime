    //so this class, I start with a stream of featureIds coming in, that are within the context of all the tiles.
    //then for each of these featureIds, I need to query for all the data related to the features within the tile query range

    //so the anchoring is a set of search coordinates for consecutive tiles

    //and a stream of features, there can be at-most N feature metrics per feature, where N is the bandwidth of the tile aggregate.
    //so this can be scoped by team size limits, or phased in with team size.
