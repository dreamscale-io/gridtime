    Okay so I've got a bunch of teams configured in the DB, and a bunch of torchie's configured in the DB
    And all of these have to be running on some server somewhere in the cluster.

    Similar to the way we lock for work in picking up aggregate work that needs doing on demand,
    If I've got a max capacity of X on this particular server, then I need to be able to pick up X jobs,
    and leave another server to pick up the rest of them.

    Then if this server suddenly dies, or is rebooted, it needs to keep an updated last active thing,
    So that if anything "dies" it will get picked up in the pool again.

    If I say I want to start my Torchie process, then it should get forever picked up and started.
    Even as the various services start/stop.

    If I haven't generated history, I need a special historical generator for the past things.
