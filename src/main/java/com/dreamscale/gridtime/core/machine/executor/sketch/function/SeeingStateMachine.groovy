        //opening eyes...
        //sensing the world...

        //game is predict and flow with...

        //I don't start having tension until I feel like I know better... until I feel like you're going the wrong way
        //tension rises, tension throws exceptions, over and over again,
        // exception throwing on thresholds of going the wrong way

        //system 2 is tension toward winning, on demand response to tension, starts to do pressure/release
        //system 3 is balance... which is integrating 1,2... choosing love and death, fragmentation, integration, water

        //so lets start there... as we listen to the engineer code
        //I've got a flow feed coming into the system, providing a Flow context, that's a continuously sliding window.

        // and if we're going to transition to a new state, based on the emergent context

        //if I see an object like me, where I predicting joining will result in Thrive

        //determining if we should be pushing away at any given moment
        //the stronger the push signal, we trip a threshold, and fire a rule
